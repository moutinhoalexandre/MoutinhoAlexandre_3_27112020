## OHMYFOOD

"OHMYFOOD" is the third project I'm working on as part of my training with OpenClassrooms.
In this scenario, I have to integrate a model provided by a designer to a website, using HTML and CSS (using SASS) from scratch

[GitHuB Pages](https://moutinhoalexandre.github.io/MoutinhoAlexandre_3_27112020/index.html)

## Specifications

Here is a list of the technical points discussed in the briefing and which must be included in our project

- [x] The code must be versioned. So I used GitHub
- [x] The graphic charter is composed of the following three colors:
	- [ ]  Primary = #9356DC
	- [ ] Secondary = #FF79DA
	- [ ] Tertiary = #99E2D0
- [x] The fonts of the site are Roboto for the body and Shrikhand for the titles.
- [x] The icons come from the Font Awesome library
- [x] Each restaurant card must redirect to the HTML page assigned to it.

## Technical constraints

### **Animations**


 - #### Buttons

- [x] On mouseover, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The drop shadow should also be more visible.
- [x] Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For this, a heart-shaped "Like" button is present on the model. When clicked, it should fill up progressively. For this first version, the effect can be shown on hover instead of click.

- #### Home page

- [x] When the application will have more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. On this mockup, we want to have a preview of it. It will have to appear for 1 to 3 seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and use CSS animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined, so any proposal is welcome as long as it is consistent with the graphic charter of the site.

- #### Menu pages

- [x] On arrival on the page, the dishes will appear progressively with a slight delay in time. They can either appear one by one, or in groups "Starter", "Main course" and "Dessert". An example of the expected effect is provided.
- [x] The visitor can add the dishes he wants to his order by clicking on them. A small tick appears to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from the right to the left. For this first version, the effect can appear on the hover instead of the click. If the title of the dish is too long, it should be trimmed with ellipsis.
